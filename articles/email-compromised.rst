Email Compromised
=================

One Sunday in May 2010, I returned home from church to find that my webmail account had been accessed without my permission.  I may never have noticed if it weren't for the bounce messages that filled my inbox and my wife's question of why I sent her a link to a site advertising pharmaceuticals.

That's right.  My email account was used to send spam, apparently to every email address it had communicated with.  I couldn't be completely sure because the person or bot responsible had cleared my entire sent history to cover their or its tracks.

I was able to get the IP address and track it down enough to know which ISP was used and the U.S. state where the computer was located.  Unfortunately, this accomplishes little for a few reasons:

1. ISPs get a huge number of reports of abuse.
1. The bot case is much more likely.  This means that reporting will probably just bewilder some person who only got a computer to browse the web and doesn't understand why their ISP suddenly turned off the bits.
1. It takes time to track down the actual source of a botnet, and the tracks frequently cross international borders, raising difficult jurisdiction questions.

So what to do?  I needed to understand how they got in so I could lock them out.  This involved realizing that they probably had obtained my password somehow.  That's easy enough.  I generated a random password and changed it immediately and sent an email message to everyone on my saved contacts list (a far smaller group than the one that the spammers sent to, unfortunately) informing them of the issue.

As of this writing, I'm still deciding how to finish mitigating the issue, as I was hiding behind having a strong password memorized as an excuse to use it or small variations of it for all my accounts.  I'll keep you posted as I weigh the pros and cons of various approaches.
