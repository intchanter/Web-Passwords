What Passwords Are
==================

When you log into any website and you see the familiar "*********", you know you're typing into a password field, but not everything that qualifies as a password is marked in such a way or called out by the name "password".  So what is a password?  How can you be sure you're treating all of the passwords you use in your daily life correctly?

In a broad sense, passwords are secrets that you remember that give you access to something.  Security professionals sometimes call this a "what you know" security measure.  You may be required to say a password, punch it out on keys or buttons, or select items in the right order.  If you are able to do this correctly, the person or system that challenged you to provide the password may count that as one indication that you are authorized to perform some action.

Examples of information used in this way includes many things you may not consider to be passwords at all.  They include:
- PIN numbers
- Your mother's maiden name (and other secret questions with their answers)
- The last four digits of your social security number
- The last four digits of your credit card number
- That secret knock that you established with your family or neighbors
- Insider information such as jargon, lingo, names, dates, and places
- Code words and phrases

The purpose of each of these is to help establish a trust relationship, and you should guard them to an extent that is appropriate for the relationship they guard.  Think of the trust relationships in your life and the passwords that protect them.  How easy would it be for someone to learn one of your passwords, and what damage could they do if they did?
